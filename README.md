# WeatherApp
This Android project, built using Kotlin and the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/) , provides users with detailed weather information for a selected city. It displays current weather conditions, pollution levels, and a 5-day weather forecast. The app aims to offer a comprehensive view of weather and air quality in a simple interface.

# Architectures

![android-mvvm-architecture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d9a470c-b022-4b78-94a1-6c60efa6fa24)

* **View**:  The purpose of this layer is to inform the ViewModel about the userâ€™s action. This layer observes the ViewModel and does not contain any kind of application logic.
  
* **ViewModel**: It exposes those data streams which are relevant to the View. Moreover, it serves as a link between the Model and the View.

* **Model**: This layer is responsible for the abstraction of the data sources. Model and ViewModel work together to get and save the data.
